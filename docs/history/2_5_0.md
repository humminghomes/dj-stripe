# dj-stripe 2.5.0 (unreleased)

_Expected December 2020_

## Release notes

-   â€¦

## Deprecated features

-   Deprecate `charge_immediately` argument to `Customer.subscribe()`. It did not behave
    as expected on recent versions of Stripe. If you were using it set to
    `charge_immediately=False`, you can instead pass `collection_method="send_invoice"`,
    which will send the Customer the invoice to manually pay, instead.

## Breaking changes

-   When calling `Customer.delete()` in prior versions of dj-stripe, the Customer object
    would be deleted in the upstream API and the Customer object would be retained but
    with a `date_purged` attribute. This was the only model behaving this way, and it is
    no longer the case. If you wish to purge a customer like before, you may call
    `Customer.purge()` instead, though that method may be removed in future versions as
    well.
-   Remove deprecated DRF integration (`djstripe.contrib.rest_framework`)
-   Remove deprecated `djstripe.decorators` module
-   Remove deprecated `djstripe.middleware` module
-   Remove deprecated fields `Account.business_vat_id` and `Subscription.tax_percent`
-   Remove deprecated method `Account.get_connected_account_from_token()`. Use
    `Account.get_or_retrieve_for_api_key()` instead.
-   Remove deprecated `Charge.account` property. Use `Charge.on_behalf_of` instead.
-   Remove deprecated `Customer.has_active_subscription()` method. Use
    `Customer.is_subscribed_to(product)` instead.
